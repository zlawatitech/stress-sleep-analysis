# Stress and Sleep Quality Analysis in University Students

This project investigates the relationship between perceived stress levels and sleep quality among university students. Using a sample dataset, we analyze whether higher stress is associated with poorer sleep and explore differences across gender. The workflow demonstrates how to import, clean, analyze, and visualize SPSS/CSV data using R and the tidyverse, psych, and ggplot2 packages. Statistical methods include descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, t-tests, and data visualization.

## Key Features

- End-to-end data analysis pipeline in R
